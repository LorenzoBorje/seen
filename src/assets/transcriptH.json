Whether  incompetence, neglect, willful abuse, or simply the fact that the CCCP forces every decision for our so-called government, the effects on people in the city is the same. The government, aided by a largely corrupt police force, and in conjunction with our Beijing overlords is, quite simply, destroying Hong Kong; and causing massive and uneccessary suffering in the process.

However one might have said the same in the mid-80s regarding Soviet Communism, and a few years later the system had largely collapsed and the Berlin Wall was down. One can never know what the tipping point will be in such cases. Some have argued (Gorbachev for one) that the Chernobyl disaster led to the collapse, so it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the HK protests, or the Coronovirus, or some other unexpected event could be the catalyst for the end of the CCP.",

The HK government, and especially the police force, have been a consistent source of misinformation for so long, that they no longer have any credibility whatsoever.

At the same time the massive campaigns of censorship and misinformation against the Chinese people y the CCP have created a gulf of understanding so wide that the two sides are almost incapable of communication ‚Äî their frames of reference so different that they might as well be speaking different languages (like the cantonese saying ÈõûÂêåÈ¥®Ë¨õ, or ‚Äòchicken trying to talk to duck‚Äô, there is no possibility of communication.)",
